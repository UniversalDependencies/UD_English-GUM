# Summary

Universal Dependencies syntax annotations from the GUM corpus (https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/)

# Introduction

GUM, the Georgetown University Multilayer corpus, is an open source collection of richly annotated web texts from multiple text types. The corpus is collected and expanded by students as part of the curriculum in the course LING-367 "Computational Corpus Linguistics" at Georgetown University. The selection of text types is meant to represent different communicative purposes, while coming from sources that are readily and openly available (usually Creative Commons licenses), so that new texts can be annotated and published with ease.

The dependencies in the corpus up to GUM version 5 were originally annotated using Stanford Typed Depenencies (de Marneffe & Manning 2013) and converted automatically to UD using DepEdit (https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/depedit/). The rule-based conversion took into account gold entity annotations found in other annotation layers of the GUM corpus (e.g. entity annotations), and has since been corrected manually in native UD. The original conversion script used can found in the GUM build bot code from version 5, available from the (non-UD) GUM repository. Documents from version 6 of GUM onwards were annotated directly in UD, and subsequent manual error correction to all GUM data has also been done directly using the UD guidelines. For more details see the [corpus website](https://corpling.uis.georgetown.edu/gum/).

# Documents and splits

The training, development and test sets contain complete, contiguous documents, balanced for genre. Test and dev contain similar amounts of data, usually around 2,500 tokens in each genre in each, and the rest is assigned to training. For the exact file lists in each split see:
